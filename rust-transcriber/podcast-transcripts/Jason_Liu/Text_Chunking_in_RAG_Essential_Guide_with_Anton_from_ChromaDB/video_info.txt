Description: Anton from ChromaDB delivers a comprehensive guide on text chunking strategies for RAG applications, explaining why chunking remains essential even as LLM context windows expand and demonstrating how different approaches impact retrieval performance. He shares two key principles: maximize embedding model context window usage while avoiding grouping unrelated information, and emphasizes his core message that developers must "always, always look at your data" rather than rely on defaults. The presentation concludes with practical insights on measuring chunking effectiveness through recall metrics and how to tailor retrieval systems to specific tasks and datasets.
