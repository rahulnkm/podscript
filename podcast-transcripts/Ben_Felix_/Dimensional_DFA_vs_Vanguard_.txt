Most people with even a passing interest in investing have heard of Vanguard, the company synonymous with index funds. Fewer people have heard of Dimensional Fund Advisors, but these two companies have connected histories and philosophies, both stemming from the start of the index investing revolution. 

Vanguard is well-known for its low-cost funds that track market indexes, an approach to investing supported by theory and evidence. Dimensional similarly applies theory and evidence to portfolio design, but unlike an index fund, they aim to beat the market. That sounds good in theory, but the obvious question is: does it work? 

I'm Ben Felix, Chief Investment Officer at PWL Capital, and I'm going to tell you how Dimensional Fund Advisors stacks up against Vanguard. Full disclosure before I start: my firm, PWL Capital, uses Dimensional Fund Advisor funds in our clients' portfolios. We are not paid by Dimensional; there are no commissions or kickbacks, and I gain nothing from sharing the information in this video with you. Their products are available as ETFs that anyone can buy. I do believe, however, that Dimensional is implementing some of the best ideas in finance, as you're about to learn. I invest 100% of my own liquid financial assets in their funds.

The stories of Dimensional and Vanguard start in 1964 with Mac McQuown, a founding director of Dimensional and, prior to that, the creator of the first index fund. He joined a quantitative investment strategy think tank inside Wells Fargo and assembled a team of academics to work on quant investing strategies. Six of the people in this group eventually went on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their respective works. It was a pretty sharp crew. 

It's important to keep in mind that around this time, academic finance was going through something like a renaissance. Harry Markowitz's work on the importance of diversification had come out 12 years prior. Eugene Fama's work on efficient markets, suggesting that outperforming the market should be pretty hard, was brand new. Bill Sharpe's work on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which allows portfolio performance to be largely explained by exposure to market risk, was published the same year. 

Theory and evidence were starting to suggest that the typical investment approach at the time of picking stocks and timing the market probably wasn't as useful as had previously been imagined. Active managers generally weren't doing anything special beyond taking market risk while charging a lot for the service. If active managers don't beat the market and returns primarily come from taking market risk, the most sensible approach to investing is minimizing costs and capturing market returns. 

Based on this sensible premise, the group at Wells Fargo came up with the idea of the index fund. That is, a fund that, rather than trying to beat the market, simply replicates an index that represents the market. The first-ever large-cap index fund was deployed by Wells Fargo Investment Advisers for the pension plan of Samsonite, the luggage maker, in 1971. Due to the Glass-Steagall Act, Wells Fargo was not able to distribute index funds to retail investors. Realizing the potential impact of their innovation, they gave their research for free to John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, who was also interested in implementing these ideas around the same time. 

Knowing now what that generosity led to, it's a pretty incredible part of the story. Vanguard launched the first large-cap equity index mutual fund available to retail investors in 1976. The initial launch was a flop, and the index fund was referred to as "Bogle's Folly" for a while. But Vanguard has since become one of the largest asset managers in the world, with more than $1 trillion under management. 

Vanguard is best known for its index fund products, but it is also one of the largest active managers in the world, with around $1.8 trillion of its total assets in actively managed funds. Dimensional Fund Advisors, led by David Booth, who had previously been part of the Wells Fargo group that created the first index fund, launched the first small-cap fund in 1981. While much smaller than Vanguard, Dimensional is one of the world's largest asset managers today, with $814 billion under management. 

Booth's idea was that institutions like the Samsonite Pension Plan could probably use a small-cap fund to diversify their portfolios beyond large caps, which is how most institutions were invested. Since small-cap stocks are more expensive to trade and there was no small-cap index at that time anyway, Dimensional did not implement an index fund, since that requires rigid trading around index reconstitution dates to match the index. Instead, they built a more flexible product that looks a lot more like an index fund than a traditional actively managed fund but is not technically an index fund.

It's common to think that index funds are inherently good and anything else is bad, but that's not necessarily true. Market-capitalization-weighted total market index funds make sense because they're low-cost and broadly diversified. They beat the vast majority of actively managed funds most of the time, they're tax-efficient, easy to understand, and they're consistent with foundational finance theory. While all of that is true and important, tracking a market-capitalization-weighted index is not a requirement to achieve all of those favorable characteristics. 

Soon after Dimensional launched their first small-cap fund, Rolf Banz, one of Eugene Fama's students, published a paper on the small-cap premium. He had found that small-cap stocks had systematically higher returns than could be explained by their exposure to market risk. It turned out that not only were small caps good for diversifying large-cap portfolios, as David Booth had originally intended, but they might also offer exposure to another source of expected returns. Following the small-cap premium, academic research uncovered other systematic premiums, where stocks with certain characteristics performed better than theory predicted. 

Some important examples are the value premium, which suggests that stocks with low prices relative to their fundamentals tend to outperform, and the profitability premium, which indicates that stocks with stronger profitability tend to outperform, all else being equal. These findings seem to violate market efficiency. If market risk is the only risk that explains differences in returns and some types of stocks have systematically higher returns than theory predicts, it could mean one of two things: either markets are not efficient, or we need a better model for market efficiency. 

This idea led Eugene Fama and Kenneth French to propose a new asset pricing model. Bill Sharpe's Capital Asset Pricing Model had predicted that exposure to market risk was the only driver of expected returns, but the model had struggled empirically. Fama and French, based on the observation that Sharpe's theory was being systematically violated by certain types of stocks, suggested in a seminal 1992 paper that in addition to market risk, the unique risks of small-cap stocks and value stocks may be needed to explain differences in expected returns. This paper was followed up in 2015 with another highly-cited paper from the same authors, suggesting that profitability and investment were additional factors needed to explain differences in expected returns. And in a 2017 paper, they extended the model to international markets. 

These five factors are able to explain the vast majority, around 95%, of differences in returns between diversified portfolios. This means that if two funds have different returns, the difference is likely explained by exposure to the factors in the model. This is important because if, for example, an active manager has been beating the market by tilting towards small-cap value stocks with high profitability and charging a high fee for the service, investors could alternatively capture those returns systematically using lower-cost funds. 

A 2020 book referred to this as "The Incredible Shrinking Alpha," the fact that what used to look like excess risk-adjusted return (alpha) is being increasingly explained by exposure to additional systematic risks. Today, the Fama-French Five-Factor Asset Pricing Model is the workhorse model in academic finance. Dimensional Fund Advisors has maintained close ties to academia, and as theory and evidence have progressed, they have added exposure to value stocks and stocks with robust profitability, which have higher expected returns. They've also built-in exclusions for small stocks with aggressive investment, which have lower expected returns. These academically informed adjustments are designed to give Dimensional an edge over market-cap-weighted index funds. 

The line between indexing, active management, and whatever Dimensional is doing is pretty blurry, but in both the cases of indexing and Dimensional, the theory is that taking risk, not picking stocks or timing the market, explains differences in returns. The difference is that market-capitalization-weighted index funds deliver the market risk premium, while Dimensional funds deliver the market, size, value, and profitability premiums. Building portfolios around multiple risk premiums should both increase a portfolio's expected returns and increase the reliability of its long-term returns, because different risk premiums will show up at different times, offering something like diversification.

That's great in theory, but it brings us back to the original question: has it actually worked? Is Dimensional's academic approach adding value over the relative simplicity of Vanguard's market-cap-weighted index funds? Comparing Dimensional's performance to a market-cap-weighted index is interesting, but indexes do not reflect the fees, transaction costs, foreign withholding taxes, and other implementation frictions that a live fund endures to capture returns. 

Comparing live Dimensional funds to live Vanguard funds gives us a more realistic, investable benchmark to evaluate the two approaches. Due to their long shared histories, we have a good amount of data to compare. Vanguard is best known for their market-cap-weighted index funds, but they also have style index funds representing the types of stocks that Dimensional targets, like value stocks and small-cap value stocks. Where possible, I will compare Dimensional to Vanguard's market-cap funds and style funds. I think this highlights an important point that I'm going to come back to later.

I'm going to compare the full histories of matched Dimensional and Vanguard U.S.-domiciled mutual funds with at least 25 years of history. Comparable Dimensional and Vanguard funds will often have different start dates, so the comparisons will start at the inception of the newest matched fund and end on February 14, 2025, the most recent data on the day that I wrote this video. 

I think it's important to mention that this is not a case of identifying funds with good past performance after the fact, which would be boring. Some funds will do well over any historical period due to luck, but they'll be unlikely to continue doing well in the future. You should be skeptical anytime someone tries to show off past fund returns. In this case, theory and evidence predict that these funds would outperform the market in the long run, and for the most part, that has come true. That, to me at least, is interesting.

Dimensional's first fund, the DFA U.S. Micro Cap Portfolio, has underperformed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund since the DFA fund's inception in December 1981, with most of that underperformance coming in the last five or so years during the epic run for U.S. large-cap growth stocks. It has beaten the Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund since the Vanguard fund's conversion from an active fund to an index fund in September 1989, and incidentally, it has also beaten the Vanguard 500 Index Fund over that same period. 

The DFA U.S. Small Cap Portfolio has underperformed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund but outperformed the Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund since the DFA fund's inception in March 1992. The DFA U.S. Large Cap Value Portfolio has also trailed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, but it has beaten the Vanguard Value Index Fund since the DFA fund's inception in February 1993. The DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio has beaten the Vanguard 500 Fund and the Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund since the DFA fund's inception in March 1993. 

Vanguard did launch a Small Cap Value Index Fund in May 1998, and the DFA Small Cap Value Fund has beaten it by quite a bit since its inception, while both funds beat the Vanguard 500 Index Fund over the same period. The DFA Large Cap International Portfolio has outperformed the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund since the Vanguard fund's inception in April 1996. The DFA International Value and Small Cap Value Portfolios have beaten the same Vanguard index over the same time period.

In emerging markets, the DFA Emerging Markets Portfolio beats the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund since the Vanguard fund's inception in May 1994. Dimensional launched three more emerging markets funds, which have all gone on to outperform the Vanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund. Finally, the DFA U.S. Targeted Value Portfolio has trounced the Vanguard 500 Index Fund since the DFA fund's inception in February 2000. 

Looking backward, we know now that that was a terrible time to invest in U.S. large caps. Accordingly, Vanguard's small-cap value fund has also beaten the Vanguard 500 Index Fund over this period, though not by quite as much as the Dimensional fund. Notably, Dimensional's recent performance has been better in international developed and emerging markets than in the U.S. market. This should not be too surprising since it's well-documented that anomaly returns, another way to describe the return premiums Dimensional aims to capture, have fallen in the U.S. in recent decades but have remained strong in other markets. 

Whether this is a permanent structural change or is itself an anomaly is something time will tell. I can't help but notice that on some metrics, the U.S. market today looks a lot like it did in the year 2000, the start of a period where, as I'll detail in a minute, large-cap stocks struggled while small-cap value did incredibly well. 

Overall, I think Dimensional's ideas are impressive, and their track record of implementing them backs them up as more than an academic curiosity. This suggests that insights from academic finance are practically useful to investors beyond market-cap-weighted index funds. Another insight that comes from these data is that whether it's a Dimensional fund or a Vanguard fund, tilting towards styles like value and small-cap value can have merit.

If this all sounds too good to be true, there is an important downside to Dimensional funds. They will perform differently from the market over time because they are exposed to different risk premiums. In the long run, I think it's reasonable to expect a small benefit for those risk premium exposures, but there can be periods, like recent history in the U.S. market, where tilting toward value and small-cap value hurts a lot. Over the last 10 years, the DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio has trailed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund by 4.5 percentage points annualized. That is real pain, and it's not the first time it's happened.

From inception in 1993 to February of 2000, the DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio trailed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund by 6.3 percentage points annualized. In that case, things turned around for small value after the dot-com crash, and value stocks went on to deliver annualized returns over 9% through the so-called "lost decade" while the U.S. market was flat. It's important to remember that while they have struggled in the U.S., value and small value have performed well in markets outside the U.S. in recent history. 

Over past periods of small-cap and value outperformance in the U.S. market, at least in the data presented earlier in this video, Dimensional funds have been able to capture more of the premiums than Vanguard funds with similar styles. I can't tell you how the current period of U.S. underperformance for value and small-cap value will play out, but we do know that despite those two historical periods of pretty extreme pain, the DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio has beaten the Vanguard 500 Index Fund over its lifetime. No pain, no gain, I guess, but in all seriousness, they are called risk premiums for a reason—sometimes it really sucks to pursue them.

Dimensional and Vanguard are two fund companies with interconnected stories that start with the development of the first-ever index fund. Vanguard's market capitalization-weighted index funds have been nothing short of revolutionary for investors and have become synonymous with sensible investing. While Dimensional, which took implementing the ideas from academic finance a few steps further, is lesser-known despite its impressive track record relative to Vanguard and the rest of the fund management industry.

Through much of Dimensional's history, the funds were only available to institutions or to retail investors through financial advisors. But they started launching ETFs in the U.S. market in 2020 and now have a full suite of their strategies available as U.S.-listed ETFs. They also had a competitor, Avantis, launch ETFs in the U.S. in 2019. Here in Canada, Dimensional funds are still primarily available through financial advisors, though Manulife does offer a suite of ETFs that track indexes sub-advised by Dimensional Fund Advisors.

It is not worth paying a financial advisor fee solely for access to Dimensional funds, but if you have made the decision to hire a financial advisor for other reasons anyway, finding one that uses Dimensional funds is not a bad idea as it shows a commitment to evidence-based thinking.
